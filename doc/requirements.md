# Requirements

Folder `reqs` contains an organized list of requirements for this project.
The groups are:
 - @subpage sys
 - @subpage ctl
 - @subpage lims
 - @subpage comms
 - @subpage units
 - @subpage config

Any requirement has unique id matching following regular expression: `REQ((?:[0-9]\.)*[0-9])+`
Any occurrence of such an ID in the repository has to refer to an existing requirement. For any requirement there should exist occurrence of it's ID in the repository confirming it's fulfillment.

Note: ^^ This is not the case at the moment
