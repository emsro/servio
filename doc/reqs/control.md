## Position control mode

Firmware shall have position control mode.
In this mode, the goal is to achieve given position on controlled axis.

## Current control mode

Firmware shall have current control mode.
In this mode, the goal is to achieve given current flowing throu a connected motor.

## Velocity control mode

Firmware shall have velocity control mode.
In this mode, the goal is to achieve given rotational velocity with controlled axis.

## Movement detection

Firmware shall have capability to detect whenever the controlled axis is moving or is stationary.

## Static friction compensation

The firmware shall have capability detect static friction and compensate for it for current and velocity control mode.
