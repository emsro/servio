## 2.1 Position control mode

System shall support position control mode.
In this mode, the goal is to achieve specified position on controlled axis.

## 2.2 Current control mode

System shall support current control mode.
In this mode, the goal is to achieve specified current flowing to connected motor.

## 2.3 Velocity control mode

System shall support velocity control mode.
In this mode, the goal is to achieve specified rotational velocity with controlled axis.

## 2.4 Power control mode

System shall support direct setting of desired power being sent to the motor.
This control model shall be as simple as possible, and can bypass limits.

## 2.5 Movement detection

System shall support capability to detect whenever the controlled axis is moving or is stationary.

## 2.6 Static friction compensation

The system shall support capability detect static friction and compensate for it for position and velocity control mode.
